# Passport.js

## Overview 
Passport is an authentication middleware for Node, designed to authenticate requests. 

### Why Use Passport?
- **Simpler Code**, even though authenticaion under the hood is quite complex. 
- **Separation of Concerns:** Passport delegates all other functionality to the application, which keeps code clean and maintainable. 
- **Easy to Integrate:** Promotes encapsulation and makes it easy to use in an application. 
- **Single Sign-on** using OAuth providers like Facebook or Twitter
- **Strategies** (authenticaion mechanisms), are packaged as individual modules and applications can choose which strategies to employ without unnecessary dependencies.
